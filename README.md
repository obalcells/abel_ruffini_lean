### Goal

Proving the missing direction of [Abel-Ruffini's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem).

The Abelâ€“Ruffini theorem is the main result of Galois Theory and it states that there is no general solution in radicals for polynomial equations of degree $\geq 5$.

One side of the proof is already in the mathlib [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/Mathlib/FieldTheory/AbelRuffini.lean) and the aim of the project is to add the other implication.

### Setup

Run the following command inside the project directory
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/master/lean-toolchain -o lean-toolchain
lake update
```
